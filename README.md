## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

A lot of firsts were used on this one. I learned how to animate containers and change the colors of said containers. Css and Boostrap were extensively used and I learned a whole lot about them while working on this project.


## Lessons Learned:

Once again, trouble shooting is something that I did a lot in this. Some issues were solved doing this but not all. Looking up answers and examples was something I did a lot and as well as having a friend show and teach me.
